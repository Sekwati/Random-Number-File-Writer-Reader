# Random-Number-File-Writer-Reader

An application that writes a series of random numbers to a text file when the “Save” Button 
control is clicked.  Each random number should be in the range of 1 through 100.  The application 
should let the user specify how many random numbers the file will hold.  Display a message dialogue 
informing the user that the text file was successfully saved, and enable the “Read” Button control. 
When the user clicks the “Read” Button control, the application should read the numbers from the 
file, display the numbers in a ListBox control, and then display the following data: 
• The total of the numbers 
• The number of random numbers read from the file.
